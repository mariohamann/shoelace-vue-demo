# Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite

This repo implemented what is described here: https://shoelace.style/frameworks/vue

1. `pnpm i`
2. Open `src/components/HelloWorld.vue`
3. Hover over `sl-button`

When reading https://shoelace.style/frameworks/vue#types, this should provide "autocomplete information and type safety for your components". But it doesn't. Where is the bug?
